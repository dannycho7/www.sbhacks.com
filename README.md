## Guidelines
  * Do not push to master without approval from me
    * Will create separate branches for individual team members
  * If you are assigned a task, and have not made any changes within 1 week I will reassign it to someone else or take over
    * There's no problem with not having enough experience to follow through, as long as you are putting in the time
      * On that note, you can of course just put a random commit every week, but it's always best to think for the team!
      * I am not monitoring 'progress', but effort
  * Update on Trello every time you receive approval for a merge request, as well as your progress throughout the weeks
  * If you need help, feel free to message me
    * Please spend time googling around first, though!
  * Always be looking/referencing other websites, especially other hackathon websites, for great design implementations
    * Personal websites of students also work well for observing modern design techniques

## TODO
  * Create landing page for temporary deployment
    * Work on ejs views first
      * Convert to react when design feels fluid
  * Schools list
